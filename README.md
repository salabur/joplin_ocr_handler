# joplin_ocr_handler
Shall provide a complete OCR solution for Joplin. Both OCR of files from an import folder and subsequent processing of e.g. notes imported from Evernote are possible (also simultaneously). In addition, a DB-based solution is to be created so that subsequently modified files can also be processed again with OCR and the processing of Notes created with the client or their attachments is made possible.

Based on the work from plamola (https://github.com/plamola/ocr-joplin-notes) and cerealkella (https://github.com/cerealkella/rest-uploader)
