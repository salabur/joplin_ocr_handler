# joplin_ocr_handler
Shall provide a complete OCR solution for Joplin. OCR of files from an import folder and processing of notes imported from Evernote are possible (also simultaneously). A DB-based solution is to be created so that modified files can also be processed again with OCR and Notes created with the client as well
